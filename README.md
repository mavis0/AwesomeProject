### Architecture Design

  First of all, I really don't know any thing about the development of Mobile Device before the Round 2 interview. So after receiving the Round 2 Interview email, I start to learn react and react native, because Vue is not allowed to use according to the requirement. I choose the react native because I am more familiar with it . I heard that the native development or flutter is a better choice for the mobile device development,but the frequent updates may be not a easy things for them.  Considering the frequent updates, I think react native is a good choice because the files come from the server,and  the changes can be transferred to the users more quickly.

â€‹    If the app needs to provide different services form the 3rd parties, I think providing a iframe like the html is a  available approach to realize it. Our app is response for the backing and providing the user information and the content comes form the 3rd party.

### Programing

   After four days learning, I only learnt the basic layout and that is my realization below, which is a static page and the function is just to change the value through the slider. I can't find the rule slide component and there is no time left for me to realize it, so maybe that is  low-end version.
